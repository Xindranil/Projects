# About Me

Hi! I'm an **entrepreneur** who believes that technology can solve some of the world's most pressing problems. I collaborate with tech experts to execute my ideas and bring visions to life. My passions are in **Space Exploration**, but my skillset spans across **entrepreneurship**, **business development**, **strategy**, **management**, **operations**, **problem solving**, and **design thinking**.

I'm always excited to explore new opportunities and connect with like-minded individuals. Let's create something impactful together!
